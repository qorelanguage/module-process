This is an internal copy of boost 1.71 (required modules).
It's used only when there is no system-wide boost available.

How to build it:
- Download latest boost tarball and unpack it.
- ./bootstrap.sh
- ./b2 tools/bcp
- mkdir -p ../tmp
- ./dist/bin/bcp process ../tmp
- Copy content of tmp here.

This copy is also patched for non-working group::wait_for and group::wait_until
functions. The problem and fix/patch is described here:
